Email Integration
-----------------------
In case, if a job fails , we need to send notificiation.
For that we need to integrate jenkins to smtp server.

We are now integrating jenkins with gmail smtp server.

Search in google "gmail smtp server"

SMTP server:  smtp.gmail.com
Port: 465

sunildevops77@gmail.com

+++++++++++++
Manage Jenkins --- Configure System
Email Notification

SMTP Server - smtp.gmail.com
Click on Advance button ( with notepad icon )

USE SMTP Authentication

Username - sunildevops77@gmail.com
Password - password for the above email

use SSL
SMTP Port - 465

Test Configuration by sending e-mail.

Test email Receipent - sunildevops77@gmail.com

( We should get success message )

-----------------------------
Gmail Settings to get email from jenkins

1) Goto google account -- Less secure app access --- Allow less secure apps: ON

2) "Disable captcha gmail"
Search in google "Disable captcha gmail" -- Continue

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Its time to test

Create a new job in jenkins ---- with a simple echo statement.-- Link email in new job --- It will run successfully.

Post Build Actions Tab,  we have email notification

Wantedly make an error, we get email triggered.

echo " Hello Jenkins" -- Instead of echo  

ech " Hello Jenkins"

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Build Periodically
To build the job periodically
We use cron job format

We need to give 5 values                      30 21 * * *
Min  -   0-59
hour -   0-23
dom  -   1-31
month -  1-12
dow -     (0â€“6) where 0 is Sunday.


Lets say you want to run the job every day at 9:30 PM

30 21 * * *

Lets say you want to run the job every day at 9:30 PM from Mon to Friday

30 21 * * 1-5

To run the job every minute
